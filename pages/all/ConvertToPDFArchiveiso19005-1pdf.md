How do I convert word document to a ISO 19005-1 (PDF/A) standard PDF file ?      
-

When converting a document to a pdf, by default Microsoft Word does not output a PDF/A (PDF Archive) file.  If you wish to use this format, you can specify the `--use-ISO190051` parameter and the pdf will be saved as PDF/A format and be self contained.  Please note however the file size may be larger.  

  

This is the command line to use to output a pdf as iso 19005-1 format
