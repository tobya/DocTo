Even though it is easy to convert one [file at a time](ConvertDocToFilePDF.md), Sometimes you need to convert an entire directory of Word Documents to PDFs.  You can do this easily on the command line using [Docto](https://github.com/tobya/docto). 

The command line below shows how you can convert all the Microsoft Word Documents in a folder to a Adobe PDF Format file - PDF.  If you provide a directory rather than a single file, docto knows to convert all the documents in that directory.

 docto -WD -f 'c:\path\todocuments' -o 'c:\path\toOutputfiles' -t wdFormatPDF
