How do I Convert a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet to a Comma Seperated Values file (CSV) and write it to a UNC Path?

It is very simple to convert a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet to a CSV file  on the command line using [Docto](https://github.com/tobya/docto). You can also do this easily in Microsoft Excel, but sometimes it helps to be able to do it from the command line.  

If you want to save your output to a UNC `\\Server` path, there is one extra trick you need to do.  You need to double up the slashes (\\) for the output file or Directory.  At the begining of the file path there is usually 2 slashes, you need to put 4.
