How do I Convert a Folder full of Microsoft Word Documents to Windows Rich Text Format?          
-

Even though it is easy to convert one [file at a time](ConvertDocToFileRTF.md), Sometimes you need to convert an entire directory of Word Documents to RTFs.  You can do this easily on the command line using [Docto](https://github.com/tobya/docto). 

The command line below shows how you can convert all the Microsoft Word Documents in a folder to a Windows Rich Text Format file - RTF.  If you provide a directory rather than a single file, docto knows to convert all the documents in that directory.

Command Line 
-

 ````
 docto -WD -f 'c:\path\todocuments' -o 'c:\path\toOutputfiles' -t wdFormatRTF
 ````
 or easier to read

        -f 'c:\path\todocuments' 
        -o 'c:\path\toOutputfiles'

 ````
