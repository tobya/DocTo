## Get Involved.

The project compiles with Delphi (I use XE4 but it should compile with most versions including 7). I am happy to accept any PR anyone might like to submit.

## Updates     

0.7     Added support for saveas2 function (with compatibility mode) added by microsoft in Word 2010.  Additional Switches. Added support for long parameters.

0.5.5   Changes made to logging.  -Q and -L 0 now work correctly ensuring nothing is output to console.  Must specify -G or -GL to get access to logs and errors.
                                Also -L 10 now outputs extra as logging param is loaded first.
